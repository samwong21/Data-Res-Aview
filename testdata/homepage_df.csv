Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice.

His early tracks were all posted online, leading up to 2017's Juice WRLD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira and Sidepce, the set included the singles ""Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)"" and ""All Girls Are the Same"".
