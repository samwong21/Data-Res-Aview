Susan sells Korean to-go lunch boxes filled with beautifully prepared vegetables and various banchan, or small side dishes, through her NYC-based pop-up Eat Doshi. We were so enamored of these beautiful doshirak that we asked Kim to teach us how to recreate a home-cooked version that includes these savory rolled-egg omelet slices filled with toasted seaweed snacks and a secret ingredient: Parm shavings. They’re equally good enjoyed on their own as a little snack, as a side dish to a larger meal, or sliced and served with a bowl of rice. Kim uses sheets of toasted seaweed snacks from brands like Seasnax or gimMe, which come pre-seasoned with sesame oil and salt.

299,Tiana Makes the Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich | From the Home Kitchen | Bon Appétit,2021-02-02T17:00:04Z,"Join Tiana Gee AKA Chef Tee as she makes the ULTIMATE breakfast sandwich. She stacks scrambled eggs, chicken sausage made from scratch, cheddar cheese and hot pepper jelly between homemade biscuits. For the sausage, Tee takes inspiration from Filipino longanisa, a flavorful sausage often served for breakfast. For extra flaky biscuits don't forget to freeze your butter ahead of time!

INGREDIENTS: 
For the sausage: 
½ lb. ground chicken 
1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
2 Tbsp. light brown sugar 
¼ cup banana ketchup
2 Tbsp. soy sauce 
2 cloves garlic, grated
4 sage leaves, finely chopped
2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
Kosher salt
For the biscuits: 
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for shaping 
1 Tbsp. baking powder 
¼ tsp. baking soda 
2 tsp. kosher salt 
6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, frozen and cut into small pieces
1 cup buttermilk 
1 large egg, for egg wash
Melted butter
Maldon salt
Honey
For assembly:
6 large eggs, scrambled  
4 slices yellow sharp cheddar cheese
1 cup arugula
Chives, minced
Vegetable Oil 
Unsalted butter
Hot pepper jelly
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper

Preparation: 

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. 
2. Make the sausage mix and set in the fridge while prepping other ingredients. Combine all sausage ingredients into a bowl and mix until well combined and protein is emulsified. Refrigerate until chilled. 
3. Make the biscuit dough. Mix all dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Cut in the cold butter with your fingers until it resembles small little crumbs. Add in the buttermilk and combine into dough. Once into a dough transfer onto a lightly floured surface to prevent from sticking. Knead slightly until combined. Roll dough out into a 1 in thickness. Fold the dough a few times to create layers. And roll into 1 in thick rectangle shape. Trim off the edges and cut into 6 biscuits square shaped. Place onto a baking tray, brush with egg wash and bake for 10 minutes. Brush with butter. Top with flaky maldon salt. Back into oven for about 4 minutes. Drizzle with honey.
4. In a bowl whisk eggs and season with salt and pepper. Form 4 sausage patties using oiled hands.  Bring a pan to medium high heat and add butter. Add eggs into pan and scramble. Add chives. Add cheese to the top. Cook sausage in a little bit of oil until browned on both sides.
5. Once biscuits are done. Split them in half. Spread with pepper jelly then add sausage, egg with cheese and arugula.

301,Chris Makes Sweet and Saucy Pork Chops | From the Home Kitchen | Bon Appétit,2021-01-22T17:00:04Z,"Join Chris Morocco as he makes sweet and saucy pork chops. For weeknight-friendly pork chops that cook in record time but are still succulent, we turn to an unexpected ingredient: sugar. A pinch sprinkled over the surface helps the chops caramelize and develop a golden-brown crust before the meat has a chance to dry out. For max juiciness, we finish cooking them in a buttery-tangy pan sauce that then gets spooned over every slice.

It's a takeout staple that you've probably ordered at some point. We challenged Harold to make his own General Tso's chicken with fried rice faster than it takes for delivery to arrive. Was he up to the challenge?
Looking for a way to support restaurants and cook at home? Do as Harold does in this new video and take on takeout: order your personal favorite delivery dishes and try to cook them at home in the same time it takes for them to arrive. You’ll be putting money into the restaurant industry, challenging yourself, and you'll have double the food. See if Harold, who grew up eating General Tso’s chicken at countless Chinese-American spots in The Bronx, can create a version similar to the takeout one.

332,Amiel Makes Doughnut Bread Pudding | From the Home Kitchen | Bon Appétit,2020-06-03T19:00:01Z,"Join Amiel Stanek in his home kitchen as he makes doughnut bread pudding. This recipe is a great way to use up stale doughnuts, but if you’ve got freshly made ones, that works too. Start with classic glazed or sugar-coated yeasted doughnuts, which have a light and airy texture, rather than cake doughnuts, which are dense and will turn to mush when combined with the custard. The bread pudding will puff heroically near the end of its baking time, like a soufflé, but fall shortly after it comes out of the oven; don’t worry, it’s supposed to do that! The final texture is somewhere between an eggy bread pudding and a clafoutis, and it’s pretty hard to stop eating.
Check out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/day-old-doughnut-bread-pudding

Bon Appétit stands with the Black Community in the fight against police brutality and systemic racism.

355,Molly and Adam Make Chicken Parmesan | From the Home Kitchen | Bon Appétit,2020-05-01T16:00:08Z,"Join Molly Baz and Adam Rapoport at their homes as they make BA's best chicken parmesan. Let’s get one thing straight: We love chicken parm, but we’ve had our fair share of mediocre versions. So we took it upon ourselves to do a deep dive into this iconic dish, and come up with what we deemed our ideal recipe. In the end, that means we kept the cutlets a little bit thicker so they wouldn’t get overcooked. We gave them a shallow fry to achieve a crispy, evenly golden-brown breading. We blanketed them in a simple yet rich tomato sauce, which gets extra depth from tomato paste. And as for the cheese, we landed on a combo of Parmesan, for its salty edge, and mozzarella, for its creamy ooey-gooey texture. A word to the wise: Although you’re only using four chicken breasts, this recipe will feed up to eight people (and even more if you’re serving other dishes along with it!). But don’t fret about leftovers: They make for a great sandwich the next day.

361,Molly Makes Sour Cream and Onion Biscuits | From the Home Kitchen | Bon Appétit,2020-04-21T16:00:04Z,"Join Molly Baz in her home Test Kitchen (and her dad in his kitchen) as she makes sour cream and onion biscuits. If you've ever had trouble making biscuits in the past, consider this recipe your saving grace. While many other methods count on pockets of butter and an angel’s touch for pull-apart flakiness, we weren't willing to leave it to chance. Our simple folding technique manually multiplies the number of layers for guaranteed, no-risk success. And the sour cream isn’t just a gimmick. Used in place of the more typical cream or buttermilk, it adds rich, tangy flavor, and acidity that helps make the biscuits incredibly light and tender. These are at their peak when they’re warm out of the oven. Plan accordingly.

Instead of the usual brown sugar and butter filling, the fluffy buttermilk-laced buns are filled with a cinnamon-scented date purée. To make these, you'll have to knead, fold, and work with yeast, but the end results are more than worth it. A quick note on substitutions: The places where you can tweak this recipe to suit your preferences (and the contents of your pantry) are the filling and the glaze. The ingredients for the dough, however, are non-negotiable.

363,"3 Chefs Cook Pasta Carbonara 3 Ways: Traditional, Modern, Experimental | Bon Appétit",2020-04-16T19:00:01Z,"We challenged three of our esteemed chefs - Carla Lalli Music, Chris Morocco and Sohla El-Waylly -- to each make different versions of the same dish: pasta carbonara. While each variant has to be similar in some ways (porky, cheesy, salty, etc.), each chef was assigned a different interpretation to cook up: traditional, modern and experimental. Which one would you want to try? FYI you're allowed to say all three.
Check out the traditional recipe here: https://bonappetit.com/recipe/traditional-carbonara
We took a deep dive into traditional carbonara, tracing it back to its roots as a peasant dish made with pantry ingredients, and re-considered every factor. The result? Less pasta, more crispy-chewy strips of guanciale, and more silky creamy egg to hold it all together.

We're all very worried about the editor, because as we all know, Chris and Brad ARE Gourmet Makes.

Join Molly Baz and Adam Rapoport in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as they make BA's best matzo ball soup. This soup is very schmaltzy, full-bodied, and flavorful. If you prefer a leaner, clearer broth, make the soup a day ahead, chill overnight, then skim the schmaltz from the surface of the soup before reheating. You can save the schmaltz to make the matzo balls or for another use. This recipe serves eight people generously (with two balls each) but could easily stretch to serve 16 smaller appetizer-sized portions. We ordered the steps so that you could make the stock and matzo balls simultaneously, but if you prefer to break up the work, you can make both the balls and stock a couple of days ahead.

This isn’t the crisp-skinned, high-heat roast chicken you’re probably familiar with. Instead, it’s a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy, slow-roast version that’s more similar to rotisserie chicken—except (bonus!) it gets slathered in the funky-spicy-sweet gochujang. And while the meat might be the star of the show, don't discount those buttery-soft, nearly-confited potatoes, which cook gently in the chicken fat. Makes you wonder why you haven't always been roasting long-cooking vegetables—carrots, cauliflower, turnips (?!), winter squash, fennel—under the bird for a built-in side, huh?

391,Carla Makes 30 Minute 'Brick' Chicken | From the Test Kitchen | Bon Appétit,2020-03-02T17:00:06Z,"Join Carla Lalli Music in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she makes 30 minute chicken under a skillet. Butterflying and flattening the bird might feel like chicken chiropractory, but it’s all in the name of crisp golden chicken skin, and what more noble cause could there be? The flatter the chicken, the more contact with the cast-iron pan and the more crackly skin to enjoy at the end. And we wouldn’t tell you to invest in a second cast-iron pan if we didn’t think the crackly skinned roast chicken waiting for you on the other side was 1,000 percent worth it. Using the top pan as a weight maximizes the surface area that makes contact with the bottom pan, which all translates to—you guessed it—ethereally crispy skin. We recommend using a bottom skillet that’s at least 12""—any smaller and you won’t be able to fit the whole bird.

Kadhi is similar in texture to cream of [fill in the blank] soup, but with no cream, and…well…better. All you need to make it are yogurt, chickpea flour, and spices. But don’t let the simplicity fool you: Kadhi is both deeply comforting and insanely complex in its flavor, like a cozy blanket draped over a hot bowl of white rice. The exact recipe varies from region to region in India, and sometimes includes add-ins, like chickpea flour–based fritters called pakoras, but we like it thick, rich, and spice-forward, with a pleasant tanginess at the end. If you don’t like peppercorn flavor, feel free to nix them or cut the amount in half.

401,Molly Makes Chicken Noodle Soup | From the Test Kitchen | Bon Appétit,2020-02-17T15:00:01Z,"Presented by Method | Join Molly Baz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she makes classic chicken noodle soup. There are tons of shortcuts for chicken noodle soup, but this time we're not cutting corners—this is the long game! This version is about as classic (and as comforting) as they come, using a whole chicken—bones, skin, and all—to lend flavor and body to the broth. The key is to treat the breasts and legs differently: The breasts need to be pulled early so they don't overcook and dry out, whereas the legs require a long simmer to become incredibly tender. We used ditalini here, but feel free to use any small quick-cooking pasta you have! We wouldn’t be mad about orzo or ABCs either.

Check out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pietros-chicken-parmesan
At Pietro’s, the cooks deep fry the chicken cutlets in a large, wide skillet, which allows the oil to come up to temperature very quickly and stay there once the cutlet is added. Smart, but potentially messy (it’s a lot of oil!). If you have a Dutch oven with high sides, that will minimize splatter—we’d feel rotten if you got burned.

Rich Brian will be performing at Head in The Clouds Music & Arts Festival Indonesia on March 7, 2020 at JIEXPO Kemayoran, Jakarta. Additionally, he will be performing at Coachella 2020.

One spoonful of this smoky-spicy guajillo braising liquid and you’ll understand how complex dried chiles can be. When soaked in hot water and blended with aromatics, they create a base so flavorful you don’t even need stock. The chile purée may seem like a lot of liquid at first, but don't worry: Keeping the pot slightly uncovered as the ribs cook will allow the sauce to reduce and concentrate.

He's joined by Rawia Bishara, a fixture in Palestinian cooking, to introduce him to the essentials of her culinary heritage at her restaurant Tanoreen. She teaches Andy how to cook three dishes: fatoush, makloobeh and knafeh.
Check out one of Rawia's recipes from Tanoreen here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/musakhan
At Tanoreen in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, chef Rawia Bishara prepares her version of musakhan, a staple Palestinian slow-cooked chicken dish smothered in silky onions and bright, lemony sumac, set on top of flatbread. Traditionally it’s made by roasting a whole chicken, but here it’s broken down into parts for easier browning and faster cooking. When serving, don’t forget about tearing off pieces of the bread: It will have soaked up some of the juices from the chicken and the sweet onions.

Why in the world would we tell you to make meatballs, brown them, and then break them into pieces—for a ragù? Sounds crazy, but it’s the best way we found to sear a big batch of meat without overcooking it. This MeatballMethod™ yields deep color (a.k.a. flavor) along with tender meat. If you want to use fresh pasta, go for it, you overachiever you. We also tested the recipe with no-boil noodles, but found they soak up a lot more sauce and the lasagna loses its wonderful ooziness; instead, we recommend the regular dried stuff.heck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/ba-best-lasagna

This light-as-can-be pumpkin chiffon pie gets its cloudlike texture from the addition of beaten raw egg whites.

Parbaking the graham cracker crust at a relatively low temperature for a longer period of time ensures a crisp and deeply fragrant crust that won’t become soggy once the pumpkin filling is added.

Guests, all of whom have saved room in their stomachs for dessert, will ask: 'What type of pies did the hosts provide? What was the quality of the crust? Was this pumpkin pie pumpkin-y enough?' Claire and Brad want you to pass your guests' pie grading, so they've endeavored to make the perfect Thanksgiving pie. 
Check out the final recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pecan-rye-pumpkin-pie
And find all of the Making Perfect recipes here: https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/absolutely-perfect-thanksgiving-menu
Imagine a pumpkin pie with pecan pie’s best feature—obviously, the candied nut topping. Now spike the custard with rye whiskey, up the flavor of the crust with rye flour, and voilà: pecan-rye pumpkin pie. We use Libby’s canned pumpkin because it’s reliably consistent, with an ideal water content, and few variations in flavor (and no, we’re not paid to say that). The egg wash added during the blind bake serves as a moisture-fighting barrier—a seal-tight guarantee that the bottom crust won’t get soggy. The rye flour will make the crust look darker than your standard pie dough. If it starts getting too dark while baking with the custard filling, tent it with a ring of foil.

You can make masa, a dough made from ground corn, in two ways: instant and fresh. Fresh yielded the best corn flavor and best texture, but you can use corn masa flour too, which is easier to find. You can find fresh masa and dried corn husks at tortilla stores/factories, international sections at larger stores, or online. Whichever masa you choose, be sure to save some of the chile purée from the pork filling.

477,Pastry Chef Attempts to Make Gourmet Ruffles | Gourmet Makes | Bon Appétit,2019-10-22T16:00:06Z,"Join Claire Saffitz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she attempts to make gourmet Ruffles.
Ruffles became a fixture of the Iowa State Fair in 1949, a year after they first became available to consumers. For almost two decades, The Ruffle Stacking Competition was the fair’s biggest attraction, drawing competitors and spectators alike from every corner of the country. This story is about the Ruffle Stacking Competition of 1966, which just so happened to be the very last Ruffle Stacking Competition. This story is a tall tale but also exactly how it happened. 
But first, how does a Ruffle Stacking Competition work? It’s very simple, actually. Ruffles, so named for their ridges, come in all shapes and sizes and can be stacked upon each other, ridge in ridge. In a Ruffle Stacking Competition, the contestant who can stack the most ruffles before the stack topples wins. Contestants cannot bring their own Ruffles. There is no time limit. Simple.
The all-time record going into the 1966 competition was sixty seven. This year there would be eight contestants, seven of whom were veteran stackers. The eighth was a twelve-year-old who had never stacked a Ruffle in her life. The eighth’s name was Sarah Lodge. 
Sarah entered into the competition solely for the one thousand dollar cash prize. Her father had passed some years earlier, leaving their dairy farm to be tended by Sarah and her mother. But in May of 1966, Sarah’s mother took ill and the farm fell into decline. Her mother, now bedridden, needed medication  they could scarcely afford, so Sarah entered the Ruffle Stacking Competition. 
August 27th, 1966 was the perfect day for stacking Ruffs. The veteran stackers were already waiting behind the curtain when Sarah arrived at nine in the morning. They wore things like protective goggles and custom Ruffle stacking gloves, whereas she wore what she wore every day: overalls and her dusty Chuck Taylors. She could hear the hooting and stomping get louder and louder as the audience grew impatient. Finally, the contestants took the stage and the applause exploded, like that first bite of fried butter on a stick that sends butter shooting out in all directions. 
Sarah was nervous, but she had one thing guiding her hands that the career stackers didn’t have: love. She was doing this for her mom. The shot of the starting pistol rang out and the competition began. The veterans were already on the tenth and fifteenth Ruffles in their stacks by the time Sarah added her third. By the time the first veteran’s stack fell (at twenty three) Sarah had finally reached eleven chips. One bye one, the experienced stackers’ towers toppled over. And finally, by the time her final competitor’s stack fell (at fifty four) Sarah’s stack stood at thirty one. The crowd didn’t know what to do but sit and watch what promised to be a dull show.
But then Sarah’s stack reached sixty seven Ruffles. The record. The crowd was in it. Perched on the tips of her toes, Sarah added the sixty eighth chip and a palpable shockwave of awe ran through the crowd. She had, in fact, won the competition over an hour and a half ago, but something compelled her to keep going. At first a chair was brought in for her to stand on, then a ladder. Then an even bigger ladder. The crowd was so quiet you could have heard a ladybug sneeze by the time Sarah stacked her two hundred and twentieth Ruffle. As she reached the top rung of the ladder (four hundred and thirty six Ruffles), event crews rushed around her to cut a whole in the top of the tent so she could continue to add to her stack. Five hundred. Six hundred. 
More than twenty five hours in, Sarah stood on a stack of three ladders next to her stack of nine hundred and ninety nine Ruffles. She looked away from her work and off into the distance. There was her house, a mere ten miles away, with her mom in it. She looked back at her stack, placed her one thousandth Ruffle to the top and then made her way down. At the bottom of the ladder, the crowd watched her silently. Some man in a suit gave her a check for one thousand dollars. Sarah went home.
Next year, the Ruffle Stacking Competition would be replaced by the Pringle Stacking Competition, and it just wasn’t the same.

This recipe is from chef Vivek Surti of Tailor in Nashville, No. 7 on our 2019 Hot Ten list. “In India you’ll find pork dishes in Roman Catholic areas, like Goa. When I think of pork in America, my mind goes to barbecue: rubbed with spices, cooked low and slow, and served with slaw,” he says. “I give this pork the Goa spice treatment, roast it, and reinforce the flavors of the marinade (it’s got both fennel and coriander seeds) with our version of slaw, which has fennel and cilantro.” A note from the BA Test Kitchen: The chile paste for this pork is added in two stages. Initially it acts as a marinade and permeates the interior of the roast. After a second addition is applied, it’s roasted over high heat to create a spicy, toasty bark.

The Sour Patch Kids met in high school in Wichita, Kansas in 1964 and within two years were touring the world. At the time, they couldn’t have known they would become the biggest pop act of the decade, but with the perfect blend of talent, timing and dedication their ascension seems almost preordained in retrospect. Jimmy Redd’s swooning vocals, Janet Cherry’s lead guitar, Bill Lemon’s bouncy bass and Martha Green’s driving drums were met by screaming fans from Kansas to Kyoto. The songs “My Sugar Kid” (1965) and “Your Sour Smile” (1967) are now considered important contributions to the American music canon.
These were the good years. The band’s legend grew and the money poured in. Their label, Sweet Sounds Music Group, pushed them to reach their audiences in new ways, building out their merchandising arm into clothing, lunch boxes and even a sour sugar-coated gummy candy. However, the label was also arguably responsible for the band’s downfall. In response to slightly drooping numbers, the label, citing a clause in the band’s contract that the four excited teenagers did not notice before signing back in 1964, added a new member to the group: Barry Blue. The new member of The Sour Patch Kids was not well received, within the band or by the fans. Critics considered his music style to be a step backwards to the band’s earliest sound, which many considered them to have grown out of. And in May of 1969, the creative differences came to a head and the band broke up. The label had the original four members blacklisted and they stopped making music all together. The only remnant of their success is the music they made and the Sour Patch Kids candy which remains popular to this day.

Everybody remembers where they were on that day in 1983 when Hot Pockets first appeared. It was a giant leap into the future. A miracle some called it, for nobody could seem to say where the Hot Pockets came from. They just existed. Food, and therefore humanity, would never be the same again. The efficiency, the culinary explosion, a modern miracle that truly served as an evolutionary step for all of mankind. An entire meal in a pocket that you could hold in your hand. Joy in the streets was met by existential dread. Where could humanity go from here? Had we truly reached our civilizational zenith? Religions formed over night, some might even say cults. But then a second flavor appeared. And then a third. And now over fifty, each richer and more complex than the last. Since that day in 1983, humanity has been on the precipice of our next phase of being, but for one obstacle in the way. How are you supposed to eat a Hot Pocket without burning the hell out of the inside of your mouth? I mean, come on. It’s crazy hot, but it’s seriously impossible to wait just five minutes until it comes out of the microwave. No, I need it now. Give me that Hot Pocket.

501,Pastry Chef Attempts to Make Gourmet M&M's | Gourmet Makes | Bon Appétit,2019-09-11T16:00:10Z,"Join Claire Saffitz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she attempts to make gourmet M&M's. M&M's are available in just about every color known to man, but there is one color that is objectively the best: green. Scientists have puzzled over this curiosity since the inception of M&M's in 1941. MIT Professor of Cognitive Sciences Dr. Bertrand Mathers has dedicated the entirety of his postdoctoral studies to this conundrum, labeling it the Green M&M Dilemma. With the dedicated assistance of researcher Loretta Marshall, Mathers has finally unveiled his ultimate theory on the subject. “After more than fifty years of sleepless nights, proposed and rejected ideas and quite a few cavities,” Dr. Mathers read from a lectern at an August 15, 2019 press conference, “My life’s work has finally reached its culmination. I have found the solution to the Green M&M Dilemma.” Dr. Mathers, never one to skimp on dramatics, spun around to face a chalkboard covered by a red velvet curtain. Pulling it aside, he revealed his grand solution: ‘The color green is the best color, so therefore green M&M’s are the best M&M’s.’ A stunned silence in the crowd was quickly following by a standing ovation lasting over five minutes. Finally, as the applause died down, Dr. Mathers, red-cheeked and clutching a bottle of celebratory champagne, added: “And now we begin our studies into why blue M&M’s are definitely the next best M&M’s!”

And so this crowd-feeding ""oven pancake"" was born: Making one giant pancake instead of a bunch of smaller ones means that everyone will sit down to pancake breakfast at the same time. And because it's no flip, you don't have to worry about your spatula ""skills."" Use the 10 minutes when the pancake is in the oven to locate your maple syrup and butter and get plates onto the table.

We always seek out dry scallops, which will sear and caramelize better. Ask your fishmonger before you buy—it really makes a difference.

Then hang the skewers off the edge of the grill so you can pick them up with your (gloved) hands—no need for tongs.

But where do Pop-Tarts come from? Pop-Tarts (scilis erumpant) may be a childhood favorite of many, but their history long predates everybody who enjoys them today. First discovered by the ancient Kellogians around 300 BC (and not cooked -- or toasted -- over flame until 100 BC), they were originally found in nature in four distinct forms: apple currant jelly, strawberry, blueberry and brown sugar-cinnamon. Throughout the following centuries, the Kellogian empire would grow and flourish largely due to the cultivation and trade of Pop-Tarts. Today, Pop-Tarts are available in 30 different forms and the Kellogg empire lives on. For more reading, see: ‘The Kellogg Empire: 600-100 BC’, ‘The Search for the First Pop-Tart’ and ‘How to Legally Grow Your Own Pop-Tarts.’

Red: Life is about power and you will stop at nothing to exert your influence over others. Be careful, because red Starbursts are in short supply and pursuing them is a lonely path. 
Pink: Compassion is at the center of your life. Make sure that you're not too generous or you'll end up with no pink Starbursts for yourself.
Orange: This flavor is not bad. If you like it, that's good. 
Yellow: Some people call you quirky, others say you're eccentric. You go through life trying to fit the square piece into the round hole. But that's ok, because there will always be lots of yellow Starbursts for you to eat.

At the end of the day, they're all delicious. Join pastry chef Claire Saffitz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she attempts to make gourmet Starburst.

557,Andy Makes Pasta with Bolognese Sauce | From the Test Kitchen | Bon Appétit,2019-05-31T16:00:06Z,"Join Andy in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as he makes BA's very best bolognese. It doesn’t take a lot of ingredients (or a lot of money) to make a classic Bolognese recipe. What it does take, though, is patience for the sauce to achieve the ideal authentic texture. You’re going to go low and slow—it’ll take around 3 hours, but most of that cook time is hands-off.

Salting the potatoes ahead of time draws out some of their liquid and guarantees they’re well seasoned, but skip this step if you want some of that moisture when you take a bite!
Check out the recipe here:

10 large eggs
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more
2 lb. Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6), peeled, cut into ¼” slices
2 cups extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, halved, thinly sliced lengthwise

Beat eggs, pepper, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl; set aside.

Pat potatoes dry with a clean towel. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook potatoes, turning occasionally, until tender, 8–10 minutes (you can cover the skillet in the beginning; the potatoes should be white, not brown). Add onions in batches and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4–6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer potato mixture to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool slightly. Strain oil into a heatproof bowl. Wipe out skillet.

Beat eggs again until frothy. Add potato mixture to eggs; season with 1 tsp. salt. Heat ¼ cup reserved oil in same skillet over medium-high (chill remaining oil and reserve for another use). Add egg mixture, arranging potatoes to submerge. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, making sure potatoes are submerged but mostly undisturbed, until eggs are almost set and top is still slightly runny, 15–20 minutes.

Invert tortilla onto a large plate, then slide back into skillet browned side up. Cook over medium heat until golden on the bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes more.

Cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.

*Do Ahead:* Tortilla can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.

Pizza dough is usually sold as a 1-lb. ball. You only need 12 oz. for this cast-iron pizza recipe. We used a 10"" pan, so if yours is bigger, use a bit more dough. Cooking sausage in the pan before adding the dough infuses the crust with porky flavor.

758,Andy Makes Confetti Rice with Chicken | Bon Appétit,2018-01-09T17:02:10Z,"We took a page from chef and author David Tanis and added a bunch of seedy, pickley things to our sushi rice.

Get the recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/confetti-rice-with-chicken-in-spicy-garlic-broth

INGREDIENTS
2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 1½ pounds total)
5 scallions
3 garlic cloves, smashed
½ red chile (such as Fresno), seeds removed, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
Kosher salt
1 cup sushi or other short-grain rice
1 medium Persian cucumber, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise
¼ cup pickled ginger, finely chopped, plus 1 tablespoon pickling juice
1 tablespoon toasted black sesame seeds, plus more for serving

RECIPE PREPARATION
Cover chicken with 5 cups water in a medium pot. Cut white and pale green parts from scallions (reserve dark green parts) and add to pot, along with garlic, chile, tamari, and 2 tsp. salt (chicken should be just submerged in pot; if not, add more water to completely cover). Heat pot over medium-high. As soon as liquid begins to boil, immediately reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer until chicken is cooked through, 16–20 minutes (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a piece should register 155°; temperature will continue to rise once off heat). Transfer chicken to a plate; let cool slightly. Using a spider or slotted spoon, remove and discard solids from broth. Keep broth warm over low heat.
Meanwhile, rinse rice in a fine-mesh sieve, stirring with your fingers, until liquid runs mostly clear. Shake off excess water and transfer to a medium saucepan; add a pinch of salt. Add 1¼ cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, 18–22 minutes. Fluff with a fork; cover and let sit 10 minutes.
Finely chop reserved dark green parts from scallions and set aside 1 Tbsp. for sprinkling. Toss remaining chopped scallions, rice, cucumber, ginger, pickling juice, and 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula in a large bowl until rice looks speckled; season with salt.
Pull chicken meat off bones; thinly slice. Divide rice and chicken among bowls and pour some hot broth over. Sprinkle each bowl with sesame seeds and reserved scallions. Reserve leftover broth for sipping.

Make the whole menu: https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/feast-of-the-seven-fishes-menu

INGREDIENTS
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, sliced
¾ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup dry white wine
1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
Kosher salt
1 pound spaghetti
2 pounds mussels, scrubbed, debearded
2 pounds large shrimp, peeled, deveined
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Lemon wedges (for serving)

RECIPE PREPARATION
Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until golden and softened, 8–10 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant and garlic is softened, about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly darkened in color and starts sticking to bottom of pan, about 4 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring often, until the smell of the alcohol is almost completely gone, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes and juices, crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring often, until sauce thickens slightly, 8–10 minutes. Taste and season sauce with salt.
Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package directions. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.
Add mussels, shrimp, and ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid to sauce. Cover and cook, shaking pot occasionally, until mussels open, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, pick out shrimp and mussels and transfer to a large bowl, discarding any mussels that have not opened. Loosely cover with foil to keep warm.
Add pasta and another ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid to sauce and stir to coat. Reduce heat to medium, add butter, and continue to cook, stirring and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce coats pasta, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, return shrimp and mussels to pot, and carefully toss to combine. Mix in parsley and lemon juice.
Transfer pasta to a platter and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.

The first test is Genoise cake, an Italian sponge cake. For the creamy filling, Claire uses 7 minute frosting. The second test is yellow cake and buttercream filling. Next comes chiffon cake, a light cake that uses vegetable oil. Finally, with some help from Test Kitchen Manager Brad Leone, Claire decides to ""Frankenstein"" the recipe.

The sugar matters, too. Conventional granulated is too fine and raw sugar is too coarse—it won't stick to the churros.

944,The Best New BBQ Joint in America | America's Best New Restaurants | Bon Appétit,2016-09-30T17:00:38Z,"Buxton Hall's chef and pitmaster Elliott Moss will be the first to tell you he's not classically trained. In fact, he got his start in the kitchen of a South Carolina Chick-fil-A. After years of chasing his dream of opening up a BBQ restaurant, Moss opened Buxton Hall in Asheville, NC.

""You can smell great barbecue long before you walk through the door.
Outside Buxton Hall Barbecue, it’s no different: The air hangs with the faintly smoky aroma of crispy pork. It only intensifies as you enter the brick-walled space, past T-shirts for sale (my favorite: SMOKED WHILE YOU SLEEP). In the open kitchen, pitmaster Elliott Moss stands over a whole pig, picking and chopping hunks of smoked meat. This is hog heaven.

We’re in the midst of a barbecue boom. Old-school joints are getting their due, and new-school smokehouses like Buxton Hall are proudly carrying on the tradition while shaking things up. Here barbecue means local pasture-raised pig (not the usual commodity stuff) smoked 18 hours over oak, cherry, and hickory. The pork is juicy and sweet and melts in your mouth. It’s how Moss learned it from his grandfather growing up in Florence, South Carolina.

The egg-enriched buttermilk mixture makes for an especially crunchy and craggy coating. This recipe is from Buxton Hall, one of the Hot 10, America's Best New Restaurants 2016.""

""We want you to feel like you're at somebody's home, being taken care of really well."" -Elliott Moss, pitmaster-owner, Buxton Hall.

""Good ’cue isn’t the only thing that makes the experience. The fried chicken sandwich—the meat smoked before it hits the fryer—was the best version of that now ubiquitous dish I had all year. Mussels, which should have no business in a barbecue joint, were so good I sopped up the smoked tomato sauce with buttermilk hushpuppies.

Sides, so forgettable at other spots, are anything but. Green beans catch drippings beneath the pigs; collards swim with swine bits and cider vinegar; potatoes are smoked, mashed, and topped with hog gravy. A twist on the classics with one thing in common: the flavors of the pig. And that’s what Buxton Hall is all about.

It’s no secret that we’re living in the midst of a bona fide barbecue boom. Old-school joints are finally getting their due, and new-school smokehouses—like Buxton Hall—are proudly carrying on the tradition while shaking things up a little. Here barbecue means local pasture-raised pig (not the usual commodity stuff), smoked 18 hours over a mixture of oak, cherry, and hickory, until it's juicy and sweet—just how chef Elliot Moss learned it from his grandfather in Florence, South Carolina. That said, whole-hog ’cue isn’t the only thing going on in this gigantic dining hall. (If it appears to be the size of a roller rink, that's because it once was one.) The juicy fried chicken sandwich is topped with creamy white barbecue sauce and pimiento cheese and a slice of American cheese. Sides, often forgettable at other barbecue places, allow Moss to flex his creative muscles: green beans cook under the pig, catching all those fatty drippings; potatoes are smoked, then mashed and topped with hog gravy; braised collard greens are swimming with swine bits and a healthy spike of cider vinegar. All these twists on the classics have one thing in common—the flavors of the pig. Ultimately, that's what Buxton Hall is all about.""

The first Waffle House diner opened in Atlanta, Georgia in 1955. Today, the chain restaurant has more than 1,700 locations in 25 states, mostly in the South. Waffle House is known for being open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Knowlton's full day on the job starts a little before 7 AM. All Waffle House employees must be either clean-shaven or wear a beard guard, so Knowlton decides to shave the beard. Once Knowlton has his uniform, his on-the-job training an orientation begins. He gets to work making bacon, eggs, waffles, Texas toast, and hash browns.

During his down time, Knowlton sits down with Waffle House co-founder, Tom Forkner to learn more about the eatery's history. 

One of the daily tasks at Waffle House for employees is mixing waffle batter using a power drill attached to a whisk. From there, Knowlton powers through the lunch shift into the evening hour dinner rush and well into late night. 

As early morning approaches again, Knowlton has lost all track of time but has gained appreciation and admiration for all Waffle House employees.

1315,How to Throw a Holiday Party (Hint: Just Add Ham),2014-11-20T17:31:49Z,"Forget about every canapé or thing-on-a-stick that you were planning to serve at your party. Forget about platters. Forget about, like, toothpicks. All you need is a smoked bone-in ham. Order a good one (dartagnan.com is a fine choice), score, glaze, and bake it. Put that ham on a big wooden board, provide a blade with which to slice it (a carving knife, say), and a vehicle with which to devour it (Martin’s potato rolls, ‘natch; order at potatorolls.com). Then watch your guests turn into a pack of wolves, leaving you with just a bone…and the memory of the best holiday party ever.

1316,How to Make Salt-Baked Salmon,2014-11-20T16:59:10Z,"There’s no centerpiece quite as dramatic than a salt-baked fish. It’s all about making a tight seal with the salt crust—it forms a mini-oven around the fish, keeping the flavors of the aromatics inside. Add just enough water to the salt until it feels like very wet sand. To test it out, pack a little in the palm of your hand; if it holds its shape without cracking, you’re good to go. (If not, add more water.)
